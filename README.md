2. Set up the proper directory structure in your project
3. Fix duplicate `capabilities` YAML sections in configuration files
4. Validate the YAML structure of system prompt files
5. Configure everything to work with VS Code's Roo Code extension

```bash
npm i ez-vibecoder

node node_modules/ez-vibecoder/installer.js
```

## After Installation
