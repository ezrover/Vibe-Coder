      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always camelCased place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── yourRuleName.mdc
         ├── anotherRule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── yourRuleName.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Rule file in wrong location
      rules/myRule.mdc
      myRule.mdc
      .rules/myRule.mdc

      # Good: Rule file in correct location
      .cursor/rules/myRule.mdc
    output: "Correctly placed Cursor rule file"
